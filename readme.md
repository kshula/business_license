# Business Regulation Guillotine

# idea
draft code for a flexible IT management tool that speeds up broad regulatory reform and reduces its labor costs. advise on how to create a software called the BRG that assists governments in effectively managing an inter-ministerial regulatory reform involving multiple licenses and participants, and that also establishes a communication channel for feedback from businesses about specific licenses, and creates a basis for a public electronic registry (e-Registry) database of licenses with access over the Internet for all businesses operating in a country or town.

# background
zambian Government face the difficult task of reviewing and updating the enormous accumulation of regulations and formalities.

The guillotine is an orderly, systematic, transparent, rapid and low-cost means of COUNTING and then RAPIDLY REVIEWING a large number of regulations against clear scientific criteria for good regulation, and eliminating those that are no longer needed. 
It results in economically-significant regulatory cost reductions for businesses, either on a government-wide scale or targeted at specific problem areas such as licenses or sectors. Extensive stakeholder participation helps to ensure that the reviews are realistic and factual.

# logic

Any regulation that is not justified as legal and necessary for government policy in a market economy will be eliminated. Any regulation that is legal and needed but not business-friendly will be simplified to the extent possible.

The government rapidly counts all regulations or formalities affecting businesses. The inventory is placed into a database. In many countries, this is the first complete inventory of regulations and is a significant benefit.

Each rule or formality is reviewed against simple filters in a checklist format:
Is it legal?
Is it needed?
Is it business friendly?
Are fees necessary and reasonable?
After review, each rule or formality is placed into one of three categories: maintain, simplify, or eliminate.
The Council of Ministers and Parliament, by an omnibus process, takes the steps needed to eliminate regulations not needed and simplify regulations that are too complex.
The remaining rules or formalities are placed into a permanent registry where users can find information, download forms, and apply for permits. This registry can be the basis for a One Stop Shop if desired.
